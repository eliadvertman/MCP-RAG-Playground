Here's a practical RAG project that will give you solid hands-on experience:

## Personal Knowledge Base Assistant

Build a RAG system that can answer questions about your personal documents, notes, or a specific domain you're interested in.

### Core Components:
1. **Document Processing**: Ingest PDFs, text files, or markdown documents
2. **Vector Storage**: Use a simple vector database like Chroma or FAISS
3. **Embedding Model**: Start with OpenAI embeddings or a local model like sentence-transformers
4. **LLM Integration**: Use OpenAI API or a local model via Ollama
5. **Query Interface**: Simple web interface with Streamlit or Gradio

### Sample Implementation Steps:
1. Create a document chunking strategy (500-1000 tokens with overlap)
2. Generate embeddings for each chunk
3. Store in vector database with metadata
4. Implement semantic search for retrieval
5. Build prompt template that includes retrieved context
6. Add citation/source tracking

### Adding MCP (Model Context Protocol):
Once you have the basic RAG working, integrate MCP to:
- **File System Access**: Let the assistant read new documents directly from your file system
- **Database Queries**: Connect to external databases for real-time data
- **Web Search**: Augment your knowledge base with current information
- **Calendar/Email**: Access personal productivity data

### Suggested Domain:
Start with something you know well - your own notes, a hobby, or work documents. This makes it easier to evaluate if the responses are accurate.
