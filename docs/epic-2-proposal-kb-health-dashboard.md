# Epic 2 Proposal: KB Health & Analytics Dashboard

## Executive Summary

**Proposal**: Create a comprehensive knowledge base health monitoring system with browser-based dashboard to track query quality, performance, and usage patterns.

**Origin**: User brainstorming session identified KB health analytics as highest-value feature for proof-of-concept development.

**Business Value**: Enable data-driven optimization of knowledge base quality and user experience through real-time monitoring and actionable insights.

## Proposed Epic Goal

Transform the MCP RAG playground into a data-driven knowledge management system by adding comprehensive analytics, quality monitoring, and browser-based dashboard capabilities while maintaining existing MCP functionality and performance.

## Success Criteria & KPIs

### Primary KPIs (Must Achieve)
- **User Satisfaction Rate > 80%** (4+ star user ratings)
- **Query Success Rate > 90%** (queries returning meaningful results)
- **Average Response Time < 2 seconds** (end-to-end query processing)
- **Source Diversity Index > 0.7** (variety of documents in results)

### Secondary Metrics (Nice to Have)
- Query pattern analysis and trending
- Knowledge gap identification (failed query patterns)
- Document utilization rates
- Performance regression detection

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Overview
- **Data Collection**: Async analytics service (no MCP performance impact)
- **Storage**: SQLite database for analytics data
- **Backend**: FastAPI endpoints extending Story 1.6 REST API
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap + Chart.js browser dashboard
- **Integration**: Enhanced MCP tools with analytics tracking

### Technology Alignment
- ✅ Builds on existing Python 3.12+ stack
- ✅ Leverages Story 1.6 REST API foundation
- ✅ Uses proven technologies (FastAPI, SQLite, Chart.js)
- ✅ Maintains existing Container DI patterns

## Suggested Story Breakdown

### **Story 2.1: Analytics Infrastructure Foundation**
- Analytics service and SQLite database
- Async data collection framework
- Basic KPI calculation methods
- **Estimated effort**: 2-3 days
- **Dependencies**: None

### **Story 2.2: MCP Tool Analytics Integration** 
- Enhance existing search_knowledge_base tool
- Add user feedback rating tool
- Non-blocking analytics data logging
- **Estimated effort**: 1-2 days
- **Dependencies**: Story 2.1, existing MCP tools

### **Story 2.3: Dashboard Backend API**
- FastAPI endpoints for KPIs and trends
- Query analytics and top queries API
- Alert system for threshold violations
- **Estimated effort**: 2-3 days
- **Dependencies**: Story 2.1, Story 1.6 (REST API)

### **Story 2.4: Dashboard Frontend Interface**
- Bootstrap-based responsive dashboard
- Chart.js visualizations for KPIs
- Real-time data updates and alerts
- **Estimated effort**: 3-4 days
- **Dependencies**: Story 2.3

### **Story 2.5: Advanced Analytics & Monitoring** (Optional)
- Query pattern analysis
- Knowledge gap identification
- Document utilization insights
- **Estimated effort**: 2-3 days
- **Dependencies**: Stories 2.1-2.4

**Total Epic Estimate**: 10-15 development days

## Integration Considerations

### Dependencies on Current Epic 1
- **Story 1.6 (REST API)**: Foundation for dashboard backend
- **Existing MCP tools**: Enhancement points for analytics
- **Container DI**: Analytics service registration

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Uses proven technologies and patterns
- **Medium Risk**: MCP tool modifications (mitigated by async approach)
- **Low Risk**: Performance impact (async data collection design)

## Business Case

### Value Proposition
1. **Data-driven optimization**: Make KB improvement decisions based on real usage data
2. **Quality assurance**: Proactive monitoring of query success and user satisfaction
3. **Performance monitoring**: Early detection of performance issues
4. **User experience**: Identify and address common user pain points

### Implementation Strategy
- **MVP First**: Start with core KPIs and basic dashboard
- **Iterative enhancement**: Add advanced analytics in later iterations
- **Optional deployment**: Dashboard can be enabled/disabled independently

## Resource Requirements

### Technical Skills Needed
- **Backend development**: Python, FastAPI, SQLite
- **Frontend development**: HTML/CSS/JS, Chart.js, Bootstrap
- **Integration work**: MCP tool enhancement, Container DI

### Infrastructure
- **Minimal**: Leverages existing development environment
- **Storage**: SQLite database (can migrate to PostgreSQL later)
- **Deployment**: Extends existing REST API server

## Questions for PM Consideration

1. **Priority vs. Epic 1**: Should this wait until Epic 1 stories are complete, or can it run in parallel?

2. **MVP Scope**: Which KPIs are essential for initial release vs. future iterations?

3. **Resource allocation**: Is full-stack development capacity available, or should we focus on backend-first approach?

4. **Integration timing**: Any concerns about modifying existing MCP tools while other stories are in development?

5. **Success measurement**: How will we validate that this epic delivers the expected business value?

## Recommendation

**Proposed sequencing**:
1. **Complete Epic 1 Stories 1.4-1.6** (current priority)
2. **Begin Epic 2 with Story 2.1** (analytics foundation)
3. **Parallel development** of remaining Epic 2 stories

This approach minimizes integration risks while delivering incremental value through the analytics dashboard capability.

## Next Steps

1. **PM Review**: Evaluate epic scope and story breakdown
2. **Story refinement**: Detailed story creation using story template
3. **Dependency planning**: Integration points with Epic 1 completion
4. **Resource planning**: Development capacity and timeline estimation
