## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1-1.3, the system has comprehensive document metadata tracking (8 fields including filename, file_type, ingestion_timestamp, chunk_count, file_size, chunk_position, vector_id, embedding_status), complete document management operations, and enhanced Document model integration. From Story 1.4 (if implemented), the system will have smart processing pipeline with filename-based categorization and duplicate detection, providing additional metadata for source attribution.

### Data Models

**Current SearchResult Model** [Source: mcp_rag_playground/vectordb/vector_db_interface.py]:
```python
@dataclass
class SearchResult:
    document: Document
    score: float
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        # Validate score range
        if not 0 <= self.score <= 1:
            raise ValueError("Score must be between 0 and 1")
```

**Enhanced SearchResult for Q&A** (Required Extension):
```python
@dataclass
class EnhancedSearchResult:
    document: Document
    score: float
    context: str  # Relevant text snippet
    citation: str  # Formatted source attribution
    relevance_explanation: str  # Why this result matches the query
```

**Question-Answer Response Model** (New):
```python
@dataclass
class QAResponse:
    question: str
    answer: str
    sources: List[EnhancedSearchResult]
    confidence_score: float
    processing_time: float
    suggestions: List[str]  # Query refinement suggestions
```

### API Specifications

**Current RagAPI Search Method** [Source: mcp_rag_playground/rag/rag_api.py]:
```python
def search(self, query: str, limit: int = 10, min_score: float = 0.7) -> List[SearchResult]:
    # Current semantic search using vector similarity
    # Returns list of SearchResult objects
```

**Required RagAPI Extensions**:
```python
def ask_question(self, question: str, max_sources: int = 5, 
                include_context: bool = True) -> QAResponse:
    # Enhanced Q&A method with natural language processing
    # Returns structured QAResponse with sources and attribution
```

**Current MCP Tools** [Source: mcp_rag_playground/mcp/rag_server.py]:
```python
@mcp.tool()
def search_knowledge_base(ctx: Context, query: str, limit: int = 10, min_score: float = 0.7) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Search for documents in the knowledge base using semantic similarity."""
    # Current basic search tool
```

**Required New MCP Tool**:
```python
@mcp.tool()
def ask_question(ctx: Context, question: str, max_sources: int = 5, 
                include_citations: bool = True) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Ask a natural language question and get an enhanced answer with sources."""
    # New Q&A tool with source attribution
```


### Component Specifications

**Current Vector Search Infrastructure** [Source: mcp_rag_playground/vectordb/vector_client.py]:
The VectorClient provides semantic search using SentenceTransformerEmbedding with "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model. Enhanced Q&A interface must leverage this existing infrastructure without modification, using the same embedding model for consistency.

**Document Metadata Integration** [Source: Stories 1.1-1.2]:
Enhanced Q&A must utilize all available metadata fields for source attribution:
- Basic: filename, file_type, ingestion_timestamp  
- Advanced: chunk_count, file_size, chunk_position, vector_id, embedding_status
- Smart Processing (Story 1.4): category, duplicate_status

**Container DI Integration** [Source: mcp_rag_playground/container/container.py]:
QuestionAnsweringInterface must integrate with existing DI container following established patterns for RagAPI, VectorClient, and embedding services.

- `mcp_rag_playground/tests/test_enhanced_search.py` - Enhanced search functionality testing

### Testing Requirements

**Current Test Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-reality.md]:
- Framework: pytest with markers system
- Coverage target: 80% minimum
- Markers: unit, integration, slow, milvus, embedding, performance, smoke
- Test files use `test_*.py` naming convention

**Test Requirements for This Story**:
- Unit tests for Q&A interface components (marker: unit)
- Integration tests with real embedding service and document retrieval (marker: embedding, integration)
- MCP tool tests for enhanced ask_question functionality
- Performance tests for query response time and quality metrics (marker: performance)
- Backward compatibility tests ensuring existing search_knowledge_base tool unchanged

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements** [Source: Epic Story 1.5]:
- IV3: Query performance remains within existing system limits and response time expectations
- Enhanced Q&A processing must not significantly impact search latency
- Source attribution and citation formatting should add minimal overhead
- REST API endpoints must have reasonable response times for web clients

**Integration Verification Requirements** [Source: Epic Story 1.5]:
- IV1: Enhanced querying maintains backward compatibility with existing search functionality
- IV2: Source attribution correctly references documents managed through Stories 1.1-1.2
- Existing MCP search_knowledge_base tool must continue functioning unchanged
- All document metadata from previous stories must be accessible in Q&A responses

**Quality Assurance** [Source: Epic Story 1.5 AC4]:
- Answer quality maintains or improves upon existing semantic search results
- Source attribution must be accurate and helpful for users
- Natural language processing should handle various question types (factual, procedural, conceptual)
- Response formatting should be consistent and user-friendly

### Architecture Integration

**SOLID Principles Compliance**:
- Single Responsibility: QuestionAnsweringInterface focuses solely on enhanced query processing
- Open/Closed: Extends existing RagAPI without modifying core search functionality
- Dependency Inversion: Depends on existing abstractions (VectorClient, EmbeddingService)

**Existing Integration Points**:
- **RagAPI**: Enhanced Q&A integrates as new method without affecting current search methods
- **MCP Server**: New ask_question tool coexists with existing search_knowledge_base tool
- **Vector Search**: Leverages existing semantic search infrastructure and embedding consistency
- **Metadata System**: Utilizes enhanced document metadata from Stories 1.1-1.4 for source attribution

**MCP Integration Pattern**:
The enhanced Q&A functionality integrates seamlessly with existing MCP server architecture, extending current tools while maintaining backward compatibility. The ask_question tool provides rich responses with source attribution using the established MCP protocol.

## Testing

**Test File Location**: `mcp_rag_playground/tests/` following existing pattern

**Test Standards**:
- Use pytest framework with existing fixtures from `conftest.py`
- Follow existing marker system (unit, integration, embedding, etc.)
- Achieve 80% minimum code coverage
- Use real embedding service for integration tests
- Mock external dependencies for unit tests

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns**:
- Pytest with comprehensive markers system
- Real component integration tests with document retrieval
- Coverage reporting with pytest-cov
- Fixtures organized by concern in `fixtures/` directory

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Natural language query processing: Test with various question types and formats
- Source attribution accuracy: Verify correct metadata usage from Stories 1.1-1.2
- MCP tool functionality: Test ask_question tool provides comprehensive responses with source attribution
- Performance benchmarking: Ensure enhanced Q&A meets response time requirements
- Backward compatibility: Verify existing search functionality remains unchanged
- Quality validation: Test answer relevance and citation accuracy
