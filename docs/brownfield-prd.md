# MCP RAG Playground Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
IDE-based fresh analysis of loaded project

### Current Project State
This is a Python 3.9 MCP (Model Context Protocol) RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) playground that provides:
- SOLID-compliant vector database client with Milvus implementation
- High-level RAG API
- MCP server integration with FastMCP
- Support for 15+ file types (.txt, .md, .py, .json, etc.)
- Dependency injection container system
- Comprehensive testing with pytest

Built with SOLID principles and dependency injection, uses 800-character chunking with score filtering. Has both working components (VectorClient, RagAPI, MilvusVectorDB) and missing elements (factory functions, examples). Current architecture supports document ingestion, vector storage, and semantic search.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✓ New Feature Addition + ✓ Major Feature Modification

**Enhancement Description**: 
Adding comprehensive document management capabilities to the existing MCP RAG playground, including file addition/removal for knowledge base enrichment, question-based querying interface, tracking/metadata visualization, smart document processing with auto-categorization and duplicate detection, and integration/export capabilities.

**Impact Assessment**: ✓ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Enable dynamic document management (add/remove files) for knowledge base maintenance
- Provide intuitive question-based querying interface for knowledge retrieval  
- Implement comprehensive tracking and metadata visualization for documents and chunks
- Add smart document processing with auto-categorization, duplicate detection, and format conversion
- Provide robust integration and export capabilities with API endpoints and bulk operations
- Maintain compatibility with existing MCP server architecture and vector database implementation

**Background Context**:
The current MCP RAG playground provides the foundational vector database and RAG capabilities, but lacks user-friendly document management and query interfaces. Users currently need to interact directly with the low-level APIs. This enhancement will provide higher-level, user-facing capabilities for managing and interacting with the knowledge base, making the system practical for real-world RAG applications while leveraging the existing SOLID architecture.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.9  
**Frameworks**: FastMCP (for MCP server), Pytest (testing framework)  
**Database**: Milvus (vector database) with SentenceTransformer embeddings  
**Infrastructure**: Docker Compose (local Milvus setup), Container-based DI system  
**External Dependencies**: MCP protocol, vector embedding libraries, 15+ file type processors

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: 
- Extend existing MilvusVectorDB implementation with metadata tracking tables
- Implement document lifecycle management within current vector storage patterns
- Add bulk operation support using Milvus batch APIs while maintaining existing single-document workflows

**API Integration Strategy**:
- Create RESTful API layer that wraps existing RagAPI functionality 
- Maintain FastMCP server as primary interface, add HTTP endpoints as secondary access method
- Implement API versioning to ensure backward compatibility with existing MCP clients

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
- Build web-based tracking dashboard as optional component (separate from core CLI functionality)
- Expose tracking data through both MCP tools and REST endpoints for flexibility
- Design UI components to be deployable independently of core RAG functionality

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
- Extend existing pytest fixtures to cover new bulk operations and smart processing features
- Maintain current test markers (unit, slow, etc.) and add integration test categories
- Ensure all new features have comprehensive coverage matching existing test patterns

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
- Add new modules within existing `mcp_rag_playground/` package structure
- Create `processing/` subdirectory for smart document processing features
- Add `api/` subdirectory for REST API endpoints while keeping MCP server in `mcp/`
- Maintain existing separation: `vectordb/`, `rag/`, `config/`, `container/`, `tests/`

**Naming Conventions**:
- Follow existing Python PEP 8 conventions evident in current codebase
- Maintain existing class naming patterns (e.g., `MilvusVectorDB`, `RagAPI`)
- Use descriptive method names that align with current interface patterns

**Coding Standards**:
- Adhere to SOLID principles as established in current architecture
- Maintain existing dependency injection patterns through Container system
- Follow current abstract interface approach for extensibility (e.g., vector client abstractions)

**Documentation Standards**:
- Update CLAUDE.md to reflect new capabilities and usage patterns
- Maintain inline code documentation style consistent with existing modules
- Create API documentation for new REST endpoints following existing patterns

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**:
- Extend existing `pip install -e .` setup to include new dependencies
- Maintain Docker Compose setup for Milvus while adding any required services
- Ensure new features work with existing development workflow

**Deployment Strategy**:
- Package new features as optional components that can be enabled/disabled
- Maintain existing single-process deployment model while adding optional web service
- Design features to degrade gracefully if optional components are unavailable

**Monitoring and Logging**:
- Extend existing logging configuration to cover new processing pipeline activities
- Add metrics collection for bulk operations and smart processing performance
- Maintain existing error handling patterns while adding comprehensive logging for new features

**Configuration Management**:
- Extend existing config system to include settings for smart processing thresholds
- Add configuration options for API endpoints, bulk operation limits, and export formats
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Milvus configuration patterns

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- Smart duplicate detection may have performance impact on large document sets
- Bulk operations could overwhelm Milvus instance or exhaust system memory
- API layer introduction may create security vulnerabilities or resource contention

**Integration Risks**:
- New features might conflict with existing MCP server port usage or resource allocation
- Container DI system may require refactoring to support new service dependencies
- Export functionality could expose sensitive data if not properly secured

**Deployment Risks**:
- Additional dependencies may create installation complexity or version conflicts
- Web dashboard component adds deployment complexity and potential attack surface
- Database schema changes for metadata tracking could require migration procedures

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement feature flags to enable gradual rollout and quick rollback capability
- Add comprehensive integration tests covering all interaction points between old and new code
- Design new features with circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures
- Implement proper input validation and rate limiting for all new API endpoints
- Create database migration scripts with rollback procedures for schema changes
