# Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Document Management Core Operations**
- The system shall provide MCP tools for adding individual documents to the knowledge base while preserving existing vector storage functionality
- The system shall support removal of specific documents from the knowledge base with proper cleanup of associated vectors and metadata
- The system shall maintain referential integrity between document metadata and vector storage during add/remove operations

**FR2: Question-based Knowledge Base Querying**  
- The system shall provide an intuitive question-answering interface that leverages the existing RagAPI and vector search capabilities
- The system shall return contextually relevant answers with source document attribution using the current score filtering mechanism
- The system shall support natural language queries while maintaining compatibility with existing semantic search functionality

**FR3: Tracking and Metadata Visualization**
- The system shall provide comprehensive visibility into all stored documents with their associated metadata (file type, ingestion date, chunk count, etc.)
- The system shall display chunk-level metadata including vector embeddings information, chunk boundaries, and relevance scores
- The system shall track document processing status and provide insights into knowledge base composition

**FR4: Smart Document Processing Pipeline**
- The system shall automatically categorize documents based on content analysis using the existing SentenceTransformer embedding capabilities
- The system shall detect and flag potential duplicate documents before ingestion to maintain knowledge base quality
- The system shall support automatic format conversion for supported file types (leveraging existing 15+ file type support)
- The system shall provide configurable processing workflows that integrate with existing 800-character chunking strategy

**FR5: Integration and Export Capabilities**
- The system shall expose RESTful API endpoints for external system integration while maintaining MCP server compatibility
- The system shall support bulk document operations (batch add, bulk export, mass deletion) through both MCP tools and API endpoints
- The system shall provide export functionality in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, PDF reports) for knowledge base contents and metadata
- The system shall maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP server tools (add file/content, search, delete)

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Performance and Scalability**
- Enhancement must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 20%
- Document processing pipeline must handle concurrent operations without degrading existing vector search performance
- Bulk operations must be optimized to prevent system resource exhaustion during large-scale imports/exports

**NFR2: Integration Compatibility**
- All new features must integrate seamlessly with existing Container-based dependency injection system
- New MCP tools must follow established FastMCP patterns and maintain consistency with existing server architecture
- Smart processing features must leverage existing MilvusVectorDB and SentenceTransformerEmbedding implementations

**NFR3: Data Integrity and Reliability**
- Document add/remove operations must maintain ACID properties to prevent vector database corruption
- Smart duplicate detection must achieve >95% accuracy to minimize false positives/negatives
- Export operations must preserve data integrity and provide consistent formatting across different output formats

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1: Existing API Compatibility**
- All current RagAPI methods must remain functional and maintain existing method signatures
- Existing MCP server tools (add file/content, search, delete) must continue to work without modification for current clients

**CR2: Database Schema Compatibility**
- Vector storage schema in Milvus must remain compatible with existing embeddings and metadata structures
- New metadata fields must be additive and not break existing query patterns or indexing strategies

**CR3: UI/UX Consistency**
- New tracking and visualization interfaces must integrate with existing system patterns (if any web interfaces exist)
- CLI and programmatic interfaces must follow established conventions from current Container and API usage patterns

**CR4: Integration Compatibility**
- New API endpoints must coexist with MCP server without port conflicts or resource contention
- Export formats must be compatible with common data analysis tools and support re-import functionality
