- **Dependencies**: Story 2.3 (Dashboard Backend API)
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Value**: Main business deliverable providing actionable insights to administrators

**As a** knowledge base administrator,  
**I want** a browser-based dashboard showing KB health metrics,  
**so that** I can proactively optimize content and user experience.

### **Story 2.5: Advanced Analytics & Monitoring**
**Priority: LOW - Future enhancement**
- **Goal**: Add query pattern analysis, knowledge gap identification, and advanced insights
- **Dependencies**: Stories 2.1-2.4 (Complete foundation)
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Value**: Enhanced optimization capabilities for mature KB management

**As a** content strategist,  
**I want** advanced analytics on query patterns and content gaps,  
**so that** I can make data-driven decisions about knowledge base improvement.

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Stories 2.1-2.2)
- **Async Analytics Service**: SQLite database with comprehensive schema
- **Enhanced MCP Tools**: Non-blocking data collection during query processing
- **User Feedback System**: 5-star rating with optional text feedback
- **Basic KPI Calculation**: Core metrics computation and storage

### Phase 2: Visibility (Stories 2.3-2.4)  
- **Dashboard APIs**: RESTful endpoints for all analytics data
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Bootstrap-based responsive interface
- **Alert System**: Threshold-based notifications for KPI violations
- **Chart Visualizations**: Trends, distributions, and performance metrics

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Story 2.5)
- **Pattern Analysis**: Query clustering and trend identification
- **Gap Detection**: Failed query analysis and content recommendations
- **Utilization Insights**: Document usage patterns and optimization suggestions
- **Predictive Analytics**: Performance forecasting and capacity planning

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **MCP Tool Modifications**: 
  - *Risk*: Potential performance impact or functionality disruption
  - *Mitigation*: Async data collection, feature flags, comprehensive testing
  
- **Database Performance**: 
  - *Risk*: Analytics queries could impact system performance
  - *Mitigation*: SQLite for analytics (separate from vector DB), query optimization
  
- **Integration Complexity**: 
  - *Risk*: Dependencies on Epic 1 completion could delay delivery
  - *Mitigation*: Prioritize foundation stories, graceful degradation without REST API

### Business Risks
- **Scope Creep**: 
  - *Risk*: Analytics requirements could expand beyond MVP
  - *Mitigation*: Clear KPI definitions, optional Story 2.5 for future enhancements
  
- **User Adoption**: 
  - *Risk*: Dashboard might not be used if not intuitive
  - *Mitigation*: User-centered design, iterative feedback, simple interfaces

## Rollback Strategy

### Story-Level Rollback
- **Story 2.1**: Remove analytics service, restore original MCP tools
- **Story 2.2**: Disable analytics collection, revert to basic search tools
- **Story 2.3**: Remove dashboard APIs, maintain core functionality
- **Story 2.4**: Disable dashboard access, APIs remain functional
- **Story 2.5**: Disable advanced features, basic dashboard continues working

### Data Safety
- **Analytics Database**: Separate SQLite file, removable without system impact
- **Configuration Flags**: All analytics features can be disabled via configuration
- **Graceful Degradation**: System functions normally without analytics components
