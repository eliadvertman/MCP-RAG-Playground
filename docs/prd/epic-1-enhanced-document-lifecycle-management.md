# Epic 1: Enhanced Document Lifecycle Management

**Epic Goal**: Transform the MCP RAG playground into a comprehensive knowledge management system with intelligent document processing, intuitive querying, detailed tracking capabilities, and robust integration options while maintaining all existing functionality.

**Integration Requirements**: All enhancements must seamlessly integrate with existing Container DI system, maintain FastMCP server compatibility, preserve current vector database performance characteristics, and comply with Python 3.12+ runtime requirements as specified in the technical architecture.

**Technical Foundation**: This epic builds upon the established Python 3.12+ runtime environment with dependency-injector framework, Milvus vector database, and MCP protocol integration as defined in the high-level architecture document.

### Story 1.1: Enhanced Document Metadata Tracking Foundation
As a knowledge base administrator,  
I want comprehensive metadata tracking for all documents and chunks,  
so that I can monitor and manage the knowledge base composition effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System captures and stores document-level metadata (filename, type, ingestion timestamp, chunk count, file size)
2. System tracks chunk-level metadata (position, vector ID, embedding status, relevance scores)
3. Metadata storage integrates with existing MilvusVectorDB without breaking current vector operations
4. New tracking capabilities are accessible through MCP tools for backward compatibility

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All existing document ingestion workflows continue to function without modification within Python 3.12+ runtime environment
- IV2: Current vector search and retrieval operations maintain existing performance levels
- IV3: Existing MCP server tools (add file/content, search, delete) work unchanged with new metadata layer

### Story 1.2: Schema Evolution Framework
As a system architect,  
I want a unified, evolvable vector database schema without legacy/non-legacy distinctions,  
so that the schema can adapt to new requirements without requiring code changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Remove legacy/enhanced schema detection logic and use single unified schema approach
2. Implement schema version management system that allows evolution without breaking existing data
3. Create schema migration utilities that can upgrade existing collections to new schema versions
4. Schema changes require only configuration updates, not code modifications to core database operations
5. Backward compatibility maintained for existing collections through transparent schema migration

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All existing collections continue to function without manual intervention or data loss
- IV2: New schema versions can be deployed without requiring application restarts or downtime
- IV3: Schema evolution framework integrates with existing MilvusVectorDB interface without breaking current functionality

### Story 1.3: Document Management Operations
As a knowledge base user,  
I want to add and remove documents from the knowledge base,  
so that I can maintain an up-to-date and relevant information repository.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Enhanced add document functionality preserves existing file type support (15+ formats) while adding metadata tracking
2. Document removal operations clean up both vector data and associated metadata completely
3. Batch document operations support multiple files while maintaining transaction safety
4. All operations integrate with existing Container DI system and RagAPI patterns

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Document additions maintain compatibility with existing 800-character chunking strategy
- IV2: Document removals properly clean up vector storage without affecting unrelated documents
- IV3: Existing automated tests continue to pass with new document management capabilities

### Story 1.4: Smart Document Processing Pipeline
As a knowledge base administrator,  
I want intelligent document processing capabilities,  
so that I can maintain high-quality knowledge base content with minimal manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Automatic document categorization uses existing SentenceTransformer embeddings for consistency
2. Duplicate detection identifies similar documents with >95% accuracy before ingestion
3. Format conversion capabilities extend existing file type support
4. Processing pipeline integrates with existing chunking and embedding workflows

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Smart processing features can be disabled to maintain existing simple ingestion workflows
- IV2: New processing steps don't significantly impact ingestion performance (<20% overhead)
- IV3: Processing results integrate seamlessly with existing metadata tracking from Story 1.1

### Story 1.5: Enhanced Question-Answering Interface
As an end user,  
I want an intuitive question-answering interface,  
so that I can easily retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Natural language query interface leverages existing RagAPI and vector search capabilities
2. Responses include source attribution using document metadata from Stories 1.1-1.2
3. Query interface supports both MCP tools and optional REST API access
4. Answer quality maintains or improves upon existing semantic search results

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Enhanced querying maintains backward compatibility with existing search functionality
- IV2: Source attribution correctly references documents managed through Stories 1.1-1.2
- IV3: Query performance remains within existing system limits and response time expectations

### Story 1.6: REST API Interface
As a web developer or external system integrator,  
I want REST API endpoints for question-answering and document operations,  
so that I can integrate the knowledge base with web applications and external systems via HTTP.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. HTTP endpoints create REST API endpoints that wrap existing Q&A and document management functionality
2. Response consistency ensures API responses match the format and quality of MCP tool responses
3. Optional deployment allows REST API to be enabled/disabled independently without affecting MCP functionality
4. Web integration supports CORS and standard HTTP patterns for web application integration

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: REST API endpoints provide equivalent functionality to corresponding MCP tools
