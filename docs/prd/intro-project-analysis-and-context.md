# Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
IDE-based fresh analysis of loaded project

### Current Project State
This is a Python 3.9 MCP (Model Context Protocol) RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) playground that provides:
- SOLID-compliant vector database client with Milvus implementation
- High-level RAG API
- MCP server integration with FastMCP
- Support for 15+ file types (.txt, .md, .py, .json, etc.)
- Dependency injection container system
- Comprehensive testing with pytest

Built with SOLID principles and dependency injection, uses 800-character chunking with score filtering. Has both working components (VectorClient, RagAPI, MilvusVectorDB) and missing elements (factory functions, examples). Current architecture supports document ingestion, vector storage, and semantic search.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✓ New Feature Addition + ✓ Major Feature Modification

**Enhancement Description**: 
Adding comprehensive document management capabilities to the existing MCP RAG playground, including file addition/removal for knowledge base enrichment, question-based querying interface, tracking/metadata visualization, smart document processing with auto-categorization and duplicate detection, and integration/export capabilities.

**Impact Assessment**: ✓ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Enable dynamic document management (add/remove files) for knowledge base maintenance
- Provide intuitive question-based querying interface for knowledge retrieval  
- Implement comprehensive tracking and metadata visualization for documents and chunks
- Add smart document processing with auto-categorization, duplicate detection, and format conversion
- Provide robust integration and export capabilities with API endpoints and bulk operations
- Maintain compatibility with existing MCP server architecture and vector database implementation

**Background Context**:
The current MCP RAG playground provides the foundational vector database and RAG capabilities, but lacks user-friendly document management and query interfaces. Users currently need to interact directly with the low-level APIs. This enhancement will provide higher-level, user-facing capabilities for managing and interacting with the knowledge base, making the system practical for real-world RAG applications while leveraging the existing SOLID architecture.
