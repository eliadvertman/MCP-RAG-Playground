This is a plain text document for testing the vector database client.

The document contains multiple paragraphs to test the chunking functionality.
Each paragraph should be processed and stored as separate or overlapping chunks
depending on the configuration.

Vector databases are powerful tools for similarity search and retrieval.
They enable semantic search capabilities that go beyond keyword matching.

This text file will be processed, chunked, and embedded into vector space
for efficient similarity search and retrieval operations.
